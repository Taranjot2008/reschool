            The residential schools also known as “federal run schools” in America were not some kind of institutions where children learned math or spellings, it was but a part of the forceful assimilation of the 
            Indigenous people into the society. These schools were meant to eradicate the cultures that were considered inferior and unsophisticated.

            The residential schools in Canada also ran on the American motto by Captain Richard Henry Pratt from 1892, “Kill the Indian, Save the man”. These schools were built with the same mentality as in New Zealand, Australia or South Africa,
             an institution to produce mass industrial workers that would work the hard labour jobs and at very low wages.

        <div class="info-text inf-text1">
            <p>A summary of the history of the residential schools. The residential schools lasted in Canada for about 160 years and more than 150,000 children passed through their doors, some returned and some couldn’t. 
            They were present in every province and territory, with the exception of Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and New Brunswick, was home to the federally funded, church-run schools. </p>
            <p>The last school closed in Saskatchewan in 1996. The main motive of these schools was a ‘forced assimilation’, 
            the children were taken away from their families and forcefully put into these schools.</p>

            <p>The first federal residential school, started in 1883 before that some schools that were run came under the category of missions. The schools were made to solve the ‘Indian Question’ by the indigenous people, 
            asking the newly forming federal government. The schools were built the same as ones in South Africa, Australia,New Zealand</p>
            <p>By the British that were schools to produce mass industrial workers. The school had very poor infrastructure and the standards were way lower than that was expected from the government to provide them, 
            these schools had the only main motive of forcing the children to lose their cultural identity.</p>

                The first residential school in Canada opened in 1828, and the last one closed in 1996. 
                These schools were designed to assimilate Indigenous children into European-Canadian culture by removing them from their families and communities.

            "I always blamed the residential school for killing my brother. Dalton was his name. I never, I never, I never ever forgave them. I don’t know whether my dad and mother ever knew how he died, but I never found out. But I know that he died over there. They allowed me to [go] and see him once before he died, and he didn’t even know me. He was a little guy, laying in the bed in the infirmary, dying, and I didn’t know ’til he died. You know that’s, that was the end of my education."

        <div class="box box1">
                <p class="box_text box_text-1">The residential schools aimed to eliminate Indigenous culture. Students had their hair cut, wore uniforms, and were assigned numbers, with strict daily schedules. Boys and girls were separated, and siblings rarely connected, weakening family bonds. </p>
                <p class="box_text box_text-1">Chief Bobby Joseph of the Indian Residential School Survivors Society noted he did not learn how to interact with girls and only waved at his sister in the dining room. Students were forbidden to speak their languages or practice their traditions, facing severe punishments for disobeying these rules.</p>

            
        </div>

        <div class="box box2">
                <p class="box_text box_text-2">Education in residential schools was inferior compared to public schools, and funding was low. The curriculum emphasized practical skills, with girls learning domestic tasks and boys learning trades. </p>
                <p class="box_text box_text-2">Many students worked in the schools instead of receiving a full education, leaving most at only a fifth-grade level by age 18. Many were discouraged from further education.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box box3">
                <p class="box_text box_text-3">Abuse was common, including emotional, physical, and sexual abuse. Survivors spoke of beatings, shackling, and punishment for speaking native languages. </p>
                <p class="box_text box_text-3">Poor living conditions contributed to a high death toll, with reports indicating significant mortality rates among Indigenous children in residential schools. </p>
                <p class="box_text box_text-3">While the extent to which officials knew of these abuses is debated, reports suggest that church and state officials were aware but did not act.Some former students recall positive experiences, but these occurred within a system designed to destroy Indigenous cultures.</p>

                <p>The horrors of these residential schools have deeply impacted students, whether it be personal trauma or physical/mental abuse and these affects remain ongoing through generations of the survivors of these schools. </p>
                <p>The children were forced to believe that their own culture, traditions were inferior and even ‘savage’ and were forced to abandon their cultures by separating them from their families or communities, blocking all exposure to their own cultures. </p>
                <p>The physical and mental abuse that the women suffered, forced sterilizations or other sexual abuse cases that still affect generations of those who survived. The children being forced into the child welfare system during the sixties scoop, to separate from their families left scars behind on the survivors. </p>

                <p>Largely Indigenous people escaped the forced assimilation and started to fight for justice against the wrongdoings.It was until the 1980s, when the government started to act against the wrongdoings done by the churches, the residential schools, and the individuals involved. </p>
                <p>The court held the government and the churches for all the traumas that the Indigenous people suffered in their lifetime. The government initialised compensations for the survivors and the prime minister also made an official apology to the people that suffered all the traumas and abuse. </p>

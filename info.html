            <p class="ref_content">A summary of the history of the residential schools. The residential schools lasted in Canada for about 160 years and more than 150,000 children passed through their doors, some returned and some couldn’t. They were present in every province and territory, with the exception of Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and New Brunswick, was home to the federally funded, church-run schools.  The last school closed in Saskatchewan in 1996. The main motive of these schools was a ‘forced assimilation’, the children were taken away from their families and forcefully put into these schools. 
            The first federal residential school, started in 1883 before that some schools that were run came under the category of missions. The schools were made to solve the ‘Indian Question’ by the indigenous people, asking the newly forming federal government. The schools were built the same as ones in South Africa, Australia, New Zealand by the British that were schools to produce mass industrial workers. The school had very poor infrastructure and the standards were way lower than that was expected from the government to provide them, these schools had the only main motive of forcing the children to lose their cultural identity.</p>

            <p class="ref_content">The horrors of these residential schools have deeply impacted students, whether it be personal trauma or physical/mental abuse and these affects remain ongoing through generations of the survivors of these schools. The children were forced to believe that their own culture, traditions were inferior and even ‘savage’ and were forced to abandon their cultures by separating them from their families or communities, blocking all exposure to their own cultures. The physical and mental abuse that the women suffered, forced sterilizations or other sexual abuse cases that still affect generations of those who survived. The children being forced into the child welfare system during the sixties scoop, to separate from their families left scars behind on the survivors. Largely Indigenous people escaped the forced assimilation and started to fight for justice against the wrongdoings. 
                It was until the 1980s, when the government started to act against the wrongdoings done by the churches, the residential schools, and the individuals involved. The court held the government and the churches for all the traumas that the Indigenous people suffered in their lifetime. The government initialised compensations for the survivors and the prime minister also made an official apology to the people that suffered all the traumas and abuse, some found it as the beginning of a new era but some believed that it was merely symbolic and wouldn’t improve any relations between the government and the Indigenous peoples. </p>

            <p class="ref_content">The article is written about the horrors that took place at the residential schools across Canada. The forceful admission of the 150,000 children into these schools, that were taken away from their families never to be met again. The recent discovery of 1300 unmarked graves is one of the few undiscovered horrors. The officials believe that the number of children found dead are 4,120 currently which is almost a fraction of the actual number of children that died in the 139 federal run residential schools.
            These schools ran on the American motive of “Kill the Indian, Save the man”. The apologists for the residential schools argued that the deaths were caused by TB which according to most people is false. The cause of the deaths were the poor conditions of these schools, the poor infrastructure, poor ventilation, poor hygiene and diet of the children that ultimately made them prone to TB. Malnutrition was one of the major reasons and the nutrition experiments that were conducted on these malnutritioned children reveals the horrors of these residential schools</p>

            <p class="ref_content">The website deals with the information regarding the residential school, Muscowequan Residential School that is the last residential school standing in Saskatchewan and stands as a monument of the atrocities of the Canadian Federal Government, under assimilation on the Muskowekwan First nation. The school was established in 1886 and fully closed in 1997. The survivors living near the area argue to preserve the building as a museum rather than demolishing it , as a symbol of remembrance of the children that went missing and were buried in illegal burial grounds. 
            The count estimates to around 6000 children that were buried in burial grounds surrounding the residential school and as a result The Touchwood Agency along with the Truth and Reconciliation Commision across Canada that helped identify these burial sites. Children died because of disease, physical or mental abuse, and their bodies were buried without informing the families that got the information months after their burial. Efforts were made by them to honour the children that went to school but never returned and are respectively given a proper resting place. </p>

            <p class="ref_content">The residential schools also known as “federal run schools” in America were not some kind of institutions where children learned math or spellings, it was but a part of the forceful assimilation of the Indigenous people into the society. These schools were meant to eradicate the cultures that were considered inferior and unsophisticated. 
            The residential schools in Canada also ran on the American motto by Captain Richard Henry Pratt from 1892, “Kill the Indian, Save the man”. These schools were built with the same mentality as in New Zealand, Australia or South Africa, an institution to produce mass industrial workers that would work the hard labour jobs and at very low wages.
